# Waiter's Tips Prediction

![](https://github.com/filipecarbonera/Waiters-Tips-Prediction/blob/main/tipss.png)

This notebook is based on a Kaggle Dataset present at [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aminizahra/tips-dataset).

With this project I had the opportunity to explore the dataset with a different plotting lib that I was not used to: [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/).

Also I did some data transformation to fit the ML model.

In the end I placed a code with an example of numbers that can be changed in order to predict the tip based on those conditions.
